- The thing that matters the most to me is creating custom categories that I can use to categorize my transactions.
- That's why I like this existing app.
- It also has a fun UI.
- I would also probably pay for this app if I had the option
- I don't mind ads as long as they're occassional and don't get in the way of using the app. I don't want to see them as mini banners on the main screen.
- Privacy matters to me. I don't want apps to be able to read my messages, or my bank statements. I'd rather key in the transactions manually myself everyday. At this point it's a habit.

- Privacy matters to me. I don't want apps to read my messages or bank statements.
- I don't mind ads, similar to Spotify or Duolingo, occassional full page timed ads, but no ads that are a constant presence.

- I think my privacy threshold is limited to bank account details. I don't mind if the transactions I key in manually are visible to the app's developer. Ideally, if the data is only stored locally, that's even better.
- A good UI is helpful for me to trust. A known brand is also helpful.
- I don't understand encryption well enough to trust it, if a developer or unknown app says that they use encryption.

- I don't want the inconvenience of having to record each expense individually. 
- I don't mind giving up privacy of my email inbox for this convenience.
- In the past I gave up on an app which read my messages after it started spamming me with credit messages.
